\section{Project Progress}

In the beginning we were hoping to implement the algorithms entirely on our own, but unfortunately
the resources out there on CORDIC, especially beyond simply sine and cosine, are rather sparse.
Although the original CORDIC paper is somewhat helpful, we didn't initially go looking for
it.\cite{volder1959cordic}\\

When we first went to research sine and cosine approximation, we mostly got resources detailing Taylor
series and approximation using multiplication.\cite{coranac} It wasn't until class on Thursday when
Professor Cain sent out code he found and talked about the project in class that we knew what to
look for.\cite{cainemail} After some digging on GitHub, Mina found an old project from last year that
we could tear apart and re-document.\cite{oldproj} We then went through and improved the documentation
for that project and then looked for any areas of improvement. We did actually manage to find one area
where the code could potentially be improved. In addressing the lookup table, we can potentially shave
off one instruction by using ARM's register offset addressing instead of adding to the address register
and then referencing it.\cite{registeroffsetmanual}\\

We also attempted the extra credit, since partial credit is awarded. One of the sources we had provided
C code for a $log()$ estimator but we chose not to implement it in ARM because we weren't sure if $log()$
was available for extra credit, only $ln()$ is listed on the handout.\cite{efunclog} After submitting the
main project as well we also tried to write $sqrt()$ in ARM as well and succeeded, although with using
multiply in order to simplify the algorithm. We found C code online and then used the sine-cosine ARM code
as a base in order to write it in ARM.\cite{sqrtcordic}


% we can use this as a base for a table containing execution times.
