\section{Approach}

In the beginning we were hoping to implement the algorithms entirely on our own, but unfortunately
the resources out there on CORDIC, especially beyond simply sine and cosine, are rather sparse.
Although the original CORDIC paper is somewhat helpful, we didn't initially go looking for
it.\cite{volder1959cordic}\\

When we first went to research sine and cosine approximation, we mostly got resources detailing Taylor
series and approximation using multiplication.\cite{coranac} It wasn't until class on Thursday when
Professor Cain sent out code he found and talked about the project in class that we knew what to
look for.\cite{cainemail} After some digging on GitHub, Mina found an old project from last year that
we could tear apart and re-document.\cite{oldproj} We then went through and improved the documentation
for that project and then looked for any areas of improvement. We did actually manage to find one area
where the code could potentially be improved. In addressing the lookup table, we can potentially shave
off one instruction by using ARM's register offset addressing instead of adding to the address register
and then referencing it.\cite{registeroffsetmanual}\\

We also attempted the extra credit, since partial credit is awarded. One of the sources we had provided
C code for a $log()$ estimator but we chose not to implement it in ARM because we weren't sure if $log()$
was available for extra credit, only $ln()$ is listed on the handout.\cite{efunclog} After submitting the
main project as well we also tried to write $sqrt()$ in ARM as well and succeeded, although with using
multiply in order to simplify the algorithm. We found C code online and then used the sine-cosine ARM code
as a base in order to write it in ARM.\cite{sqrtcordic}

\section{Results}

In order to get the CPI and other stats, we first needed to run ARMSim multiple times in order to get
the average number of instructions per second from the console output. We borrowed this portion of the
procedure from a previous group's project that we found on GitHub.\cite{oldreport} For the sine and
cosine script we ran eight trials but one of the trials resulted in an extremely large instructions
per second, so it was discarded as an outlier. When we reran that run with the same inputs, the result
was equally as large. We're not sure if this is an error in the program or simply something that happens
for some values.\\

\begin{equation}
    IPS_{sincos} = \frac{4739 + 4839 + 4675 + 4829 + 4926 + 4387 + 4939}{7} = 4762
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    INS_{sincos} = \frac{244 + 242 + 242 + 242 + 246 + 241 + 244}{7} = 243
\end{equation}

Unfortunately, as we're working on the report now we realized that the previous report we found wasn't
actually correct.\cite{oldreport} We don't actually know how we're supposed to calculate the CPI without
manually stepping through the program, something not really possible since it has hundreds of instructions
total. After talking it over with our team and not hearing back from Professor Cain in time we decided to
search for any ARMSim plugins to help us. We did find the ARMSim paper however.\cite{armsim}\\

Our contingency plan for if we cannot find an ARMSim plugin or option to calculate instruction shares for
us is to take the average CPI of the instructions we used and multiplying it by the average count of number
of Instructions returned by ARMSim. We ended up deciding that the limitations of ARMSim were too much for
us, and decided to use the VisUAL editor to complete CPI measurements.\cite{visUAL}

\section{Input/Output}

Here we've detailed the input and output of our program. For sine and cosine, we used degrees and for the
hyperbolic equations we used radians as our results were closer to the ones the professor outlined in the
email he sent out.\cite{profemailresults}
